# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COMPARISON PROMPTING PATTERN WITH TEST SCENARIOS

## Aim
To study how the **Comparison Prompting Pattern** influences AI responses when compared to naïve prompts. The objective is to analyze the **quality, accuracy, and depth** of responses across multiple test scenarios.

## AI Tools Required
- **ChatGPT (LLM-based AI assistant)**

## Explanation

### 1. Defining the Two Prompt Types
- **Naïve Prompt:**  
  A vague request that asks for general information.  
  **Example:** “Tell me about AI and Machine Learning.”

- **Comparison Prompt (Basic):**  
  A structured request that explicitly asks for similarities, differences, pros/cons, or evaluations.  
  **Example:** “Compare Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in terms of definition, applications, and real-world examples.”

### 2. Preparing Multiple Test Scenarios
The following tasks were selected:
- Technical Concept Comparison  
- Product/Tool Evaluation  
- Advantages vs. Disadvantages Analysis  
- Historical Event Comparison

### 3. Running Experiments with ChatGPT
For each scenario, two prompts were given: one naïve and one comparison-focused. The responses were captured for analysis.

### 4. Evaluation of Responses
The outputs were compared on **clarity, factual correctness, and depth of analysis**.

## Test Scenarios and Observations

| Scenario | Naïve Prompt | Comparison Prompt | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Technical Concept | “Explain AI and ML.” | “Compare AI and ML in terms of definition, scope, and examples.” | Naïve response gave independent explanations. Comparison prompt highlighted differences and relationships clearly. |
| Product Evaluation | “Tell me about iOS and Android.” | “Compare iOS and Android in terms of user experience, security, and app ecosystem.” | Naïve response described both separately. Comparison prompt gave side-by-side evaluation with pros/cons. |
| Advantages vs. Disadvantages | “Tell me about online learning.” | “Compare advantages and disadvantages of online learning.” | Naïve response leaned positive. Comparison prompt balanced both sides systematically. |
| Historical Events | “Tell me about World War I and II.” | “Compare World War I and World War II in terms of causes, outcomes, and impact.” | Naïve response was lengthy but unstructured. Comparison prompt provided a well-organized analytical summary. |

## Analysis
- **Quality:** Comparison prompts produced **structured, side-by-side evaluations**.  
- **Accuracy:** Provided more precise contrasts instead of general information.  
- **Depth:** Ensured **multi-dimensional insights** rather than descriptive overviews.  
- **Special Case:** For simple facts (e.g., definitions), naïve prompts worked equally well.

## Output
The experiment was successfully executed, and responses for both naïve and comparison prompts were obtained.

## Result
The **Comparison Prompting Pattern** produced **richer, more analytical, and well-structured outputs** compared to naïve prompts. It is highly effective for **decision-making, evaluations, and analytical tasks**.
